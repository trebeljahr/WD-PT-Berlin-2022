# Exercises:

## Get Familiar With React: 
1. Use create-react-app to create your very first react app!
1. Browse through the file structure created for you.
1. Change the background color to a different color.
1. Change the image to a different image (just use one of your own or download one from unsplash)
1. Stop the image from spinning.
1. Now add another image below.
1. Change the text to say "Hello {{yourName}}"
1. Add another HTML tag - maybe an H1 or p tag... give it a class and wire up that class from the CSS to change the text color.
1. Add yet another HTML tag - this time try to change the inline style.
1. Make the font underlined... (CSS for that is text-decoration: underline) but keep in mind the differences between CSS inside of JS/JSX and "normal" CSS!

## Props and Components:
1. Use create-react-app to create your own react app!
1. Delete the Boilerplate JSX tags in the app component and replace them with your own <div> and an <h1> saying "Hello World"
1. Now create your own component `Greeting`
1. Move the "Hello World" <h1> tag inside of that component
1. Now make the component configurable - by giving it a prop of name and using that in place of "World" - it should say "Hello Joshua" if the value of the prop was "Joshua".
1. Re-use the Greeting component to greet 5 different people from the class.
