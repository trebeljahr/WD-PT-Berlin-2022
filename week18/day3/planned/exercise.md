**CORS**
1. Without using the ironlauncher, setup a basic CORS enabled web server. 
2. It should only have a single route -> `/api/pokemons` which responds with the data of a single pokemon of your choice! Use the pokedex API to fetch the info `https://pokedevs.gitbook.io/pokedex/resources/pokemon`
3. Now create a react app and display the image of the pokemon :)
